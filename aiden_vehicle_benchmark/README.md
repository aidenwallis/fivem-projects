# aiden_vehicle_benchmark

Time your laps to benchmark various vehicles in FiveM. Collect the top speed from each attempt you do, and automatically have a stopwatch that will start/stop as you reach the end of your lap.

## Setup

1. Clone directory
1. Run `yarn && yarn build`
1. Use `i` in the game when you've ensured the resource, to open/close it, or reset the clock.
